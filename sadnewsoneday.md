## sad news one day

> The premise of the song is that one day someone you're close to will get the news that you've passed. How is this person going to be affected and face the stress of life. You're still alive and you reflect on what your people mean to you and all that they have given you and how they always had your back.

    The very first rule you learn in school
    Is that you shouldn't try to fool the people your close to
    - omit
